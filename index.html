<p>We need to trust in our own thinking; and … if we do not - then we are lost; because we can trust nothing.</p>
<p>[This] recognizes that all logical, evidential and systematic constructs ought to be built on top of (and consistent with) intuition (or direct knowing) - thinking-intuition conscious and explicit, and explicitly recognized as such.</p>
<p>It [also] recognizes that someone who has ceased to trust in his own thinking has become a mere puppet, a hollow simulacrum; mentally paralyzed and a conduit for the ideas of others.</p>
<p>The aim of much modern culture and lifestyle is to induce doubt about even one's own strongest, deepest and clearest intuitions; to encourage a lack of trust of personal insight; to feel plagued by the uncertainty of every intuition.</p>

<p>it should perhaps go w/o saying that u should be able to trust yr own thought, else ∃ madness for u. but to bring this implicit assumption to 𐑄 fore is of value</p>
<p>so 𐑄 keystone of yr own thought must be (w/ humility) that yr own thought is worthy and trustworthy</p>

  <p>do u live by yr assumptions?</p>
<p>what i mean is, have u found a mode of life wherein u can both identify &amp; articulate 𐑄 guiding assumptions u in fact live by? r they subject to yr selection &amp; override?</p>
<p>as things stand, u very likely have ñ; i know that i have ñ yet done so, altho i aspire. what happens is that a wurm gnaws at 𐑄 roots of yr worldview</p>
<p>we will call this problem 𐑄 “níðhöggr problem” b/c it amuses me to render things unwriteable w/o copypasting</p>
<p>𐑄 religious know what it is like to hew to a standard one does ñ live up to; this is <a href="http://www.jrganymede.com/2014/09/09/the-virtue-with-no-name-or-the-best-mormon-essay-youll-read-this-month/">𐑄 nameless virtue</a>.</p>
<p>this is a different problem from 𐑄 “two books” problem. 𐑄 “two books” problem refers to 𐑄 fact that a contemporary individual (even a dark forest mentat) must carry about a book of inner life, 𐑄 refined worldview &amp; praxis of a fox on 𐑄 pad; &amp; a book of outer life, to deal w/ 𐑄 materialist reductionist assumptions of those he interacts w/. a trivial example of this is how one must feign indulgence of many popular (im)pieties b/c ñ all battles r worth 𐑄 fight</p>
<p>“two books” refers to maintenance of two separate articulated worldviews but one of them is held in sway to 𐑄 other as a façade</p>
<p>instead, 𐑄 “níðhöggr problem” betrays a fatal flaw, a <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2002/04/hidden-wedges?lang=eng">hidden wedge</a> in 𐑄 affair that can bring 𐑄 whole tumbling down. indeed, in my recent musings on stuckness, it has occurred to me that this may form 𐑄 root of my problem</p>
<p>owen barfield named this <a href="https://owenbarfieldblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/the-demotivating-effect-of-rup.html">“residual unresolved positivism”</a>. i refrain from his terminology b/c 𐑄 issue is more general than positivism alone, &amp; indeed manifests ∀ root metaphysical propositions vary from expressed (&amp; assumed) propositions. (this may be when something like “two books” obtains inexactly but even a single-book worldview may fall prey to a foul substrate)</p>
<p>what to do? begin by ruthlessly examining yr activities as 𐑄 index of belief. from this, trace back to true motivations &amp; contrast this with <em>nominal</em> motivations. rinse and repeat  </p>

  <p>it is ñ part of my scheme in 𐑄 dark forest to take sides herein on current events</p>
<p>damn them</p>
<p>but it does behoove us to keep a gimlet eye on how we are being manipulated w/o our assent</p>
<p>from the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/3-tactics-to-overcome-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/">world economic forum</a>, servants of mammon ñ truth, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision-making process for customers - or in this case patients - is often understood using the Hierarchy of Effects Framework. It suggests that customers think first, then feel and then do. In relation to the COVID-19 vaccine, this implies that patients need to first “think” about it, that is, become aware of and knowledgeable about the vaccine. Next, patients need to “feel” positively about it, as in developing a conviction to get the vaccine. Finally, patients need to “do” it - in other words, get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Most policy makers have emphasised the “do” stage by focusing on distribution and convenience via a combination of mass vaccination, hospital, physician, and drug store sites. This makes sense for the population interested in getting vaccinated. For the vaccine procrastinator, hesitant, and rejector populations, however, we need to focus on the “think” and “feel” stages of decision making.

<p>Last night I was on one of my nocturnal rambles and was thinking about all of this, and about a story my brother Luther once told about horseshoe crabs. A group of friends had been walking on a rocky beach for some time when one of them noticed a horseshoe crab among the rocks. Once that one crab had been noticed, everyone suddenly noticed that there were actually horseshoe crabs all over the beach and that they had simply failed to notice them before, their brains having been inattentively processing them as rocks.</p>
<p>As I walked through the dark neighborhood, I thought to myself, "I'm going to notice something. I'm going to keep my eyes open, expect the unexpected, and see something that had been invisible."</p>
<p>It's really hard to "try to notice something" when you have no idea what it might be that you're supposed to notice, but I did my best -- and found nothing. I was just on the point of giving up when, about a quarter-mile from my home, something finally caught my eye: Did I just see a pair of tiny tentacles retract into that dead leaf?</p>
<p>Indeed I had. On closer inspection, the leaf turned out to be a very strange sort of slug that I had never seen before, shaped like a dead leaf and with very discreet tentacles. I looked it up when I got home and found that it was a specimen of the aptly named tropical leatherleaf. In over 16 years of rambling around Taiwan at night, I had never seen one.</p>

<p>As a concept, the wendigo can apply to any person, idea, or movement infected by a corrosive drive toward self-aggrandizing greed and excessive consumption, traits that sow disharmony and destruction if left unchecked. Ojibwe scholar Brady DeSanti asserts that the wendigo "can be understood as a marker indicating... a person... imbalanced both internally and toward the larger community of human and spiritual beings around them." Out of equilibrium and estranged by their communities, individuals thought to be afflicted by the wendigo spirit unravel and destroy the ecological balance around them.</p>

<p>—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo">Wikipedia, “Wendigo”</a></p>
<p>𐑄 wendigo is a concept that consumes yr mind from 𐑄 outside in, destroying all else in its gnawing hunger</p>
<p>for most of us, there is no wendigo in our minds.  however, we live in a world in which many do conceive &amp; incubate such horrors.  many times a drive for “authenticity” &amp; 𐑄 concomitant social approbation seal in toxic &amp; unbalanced ideas.  they do this by</p>
<ol>
<li>praising 𐑄 pursuit of authenticity &amp; elevating its satisfaction over other social goods</li>
<li>showering 𐑄 victim in a heap of positive attention thereby warping or short-circuiting 𐑄 normal feedback loops which would else decay this into a passing phase</li>
<li>providing 𐑄 ocean in which such fish swim</li>
</ol>
<p>while big woke is responsible for many of these abominations in an in-yr-face sense, much of edumacation, family formation, social signaling, &amp; religion similarly compromises 𐑄 participant</p>
<p>maintaining mental hygiene means auditing &amp; honestly recognizing any such impulses in yrself like 𐑄 weeds they r.  ∴ it means uprooting these weeds in yr environment as much as possible:  yr friends &amp; family &amp; those over whom u have responsibility | stewardship</p>

  <p>how should one read a text?  first, one must have a mutual trust with 𐑄 author that 𐑄 labor was completed in good faith; ∃ most certainly wicked books &amp; while one may glean profit from them regardless they are ñ a good place to learn to read deeply.  similarly, <a href="https://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2021/02/reading-is-bad-for-you-or-what-help-can.html">books can change</a> and one must sometimes be on one's guard even with an old friend</p>
<p>that said, one may adopt particular levels of formality in reading a text</p>
<p>an old and wise document such as scripture or received texts from ages past may profitably be <em>very closely read</em> (altho of course one must trust 𐑄 translator! which is why i prefer 𐑄 king james version)</p>
<p>why is this word there?  what does it mean?  wherefrom was it translated and does it preserve sense?  why does this sentence have 𐑄 rhythm it possesses, and does it concede sense to form?  should it?  how do 𐑄 lines and stories and scenes support each other and 𐑄 thesis?  is 𐑄 thesis visible or invisible?  and so forth</p>
<p>a young book may be wise beyond its years (<em>jonathan strange and mr norrell</em>, for instance, or <em>zen &amp; 𐑄 art of motorcycle maintenance</em>), but in general ñ trust anyone under one hundred years of age w/o vouching</p>
<p>one must take particular care w/ academic products of whatever form</p>
<p>first, they were brewed in a vat of unquenchable stench; indeed, perhaps only technical documents published before 1991 escape 𐑄 whiff of brimstone</p>
<p><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/273525/first-secondly-c">secondly</a>, they simply cannot be trusted; they have an agenda &amp; they will lie to u promiscuously</p>
<p>thirdly, their composition suffers greatly &amp; there is ñ reason to think the authors <a href="https://sourcetext.com/grammarian/">great prose stylists</a> &amp; so yr best option is to smash &amp; grab for what u require</p>
<p>(it is worth a brief detour to address my election of stylistic fault:  this is a choice of character, &amp; “neuroasketic” is as much a character as any other pseud)</p>

  <p>in brandon sanderson's novel <em>mistborn</em> he posits a unique magical system based on “burning” trace amounts of rare metals in one's system</p>
<p>this visual returns to me as i consider attention as fuel</p>
<p>most of the time yr attention is being flared off like natural gas in africa</p>
<p>yet attention has <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YQtziXj9hvib6bvXu/what-resources-have-increasing-marginal-utility">increasing marginal utility</a>.  it follows <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring/law-increasing-returns/">a law of increasing returns</a>.  the value of each additional quantum of attention outstrips that of the last, perhaps geometrically</p>
<p>u can demonstrate this to yrself by running the claim backwards:  once distracted from a focused task, each additional distraction has a marginal effect.  to multitask eleven items is ñ more helpful than to multitask twelve items.  once the spell has been broken any peasant can wander on 𐑄 scene</p>
<p>yr aim as mentat is to cultivate a skill of <em>attention surplus</em>.  there are a few ways to deal with distractions:</p>
<ol>
<li>deal w/ distraction when it arises (rapid interrupt cycle)</li>
<li>cache distraction (delayed interrupt cycle)</li>
<li>reframe s. t. distractions are forgiven (forgiveness cycle) [e.g. accept consequences as circumstances and move forwards]</li>
<li>hone ability to focus (unbroken cycle)</li>
</ol>
<p>this last is a paramount skill:  blinders on yr ability to reason, stillness amid the storm.  meditation (any of the three varieties) can aid this, as can embodied cognitive caches</p>

  <p>attention is the coin of the realm.  as such, yr attention is under constant unrelenting assault.  everything from notifications to tabbed browsing to advertising in its manifold forms… these are only the first steps on a long journey</p>
<p>as a modern, yr life is structured around addictions to some extent (and quite possibly to a large extent).  u r a fatty living in a chocolate palace</p>
<p><a href="https://nav.al/addiction">naval sez</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All pleasure creates its own offsetting pain and fear of loss.  … The modern struggle is standing up to these weaponized addictions.  They give you small doses of pleasure, but they also desensitize you and expose you to the misery of their absence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or again, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/01/06/the-gollum-effect/">gollumization</a> takes place at fractal layers of yr reality</p>
<p>i've said before that u have chosen yr own disease.  until u defeat the simple bosses of spastic dopamine hits as u check for updates notifications replies comments pageviews like a hamster running in a wheel, how can u face the next tier of bosses? these bosses include music, connectivity, electricity, habits of reading, tics of behavior, insufficient dedication to will one thing, mortification of the flesh</p>
<p>pursue stillness of mind.  there are three forms of meditation which u should engage in:</p>
<p>1) no-mind (zen-style emptying of thought)
2) discursive (extended silent inquisition of a proposition or idea)
3) observational (mostly sitting in nature; sometimes <em>solvitur ambulando</em>)</p>
<p>each of these trains yr mind like a vine on a trellis, or better like an ant leaving a pheromone trail for the next ant to follow</p>

<p>Design space might be thought of as a vast, dark, largely unexplored forest. Useful potential paths through it might be thought of as encompassing working programs. The space off to the sides of these paths is much larger realm of non-working programs. From any given point, a few small steps in most directions take you from a working to a non-working program. From time to time, there are forks in the path, indicating a choice among working alternatives. In unexplored territory, the prudent strategy is never to stray too far from the path. Now, if one has a map, a shortcut through the trekless thicket that might save miles may be evident. Of course, pioneers, by definition, don’t have maps. By taking small steps in any direction, they know that it is never more than a few steps back to a working system.</p>

  <p>navigating the dark forest is not an inherently masculine project, although i rather expect that strategies must differ for men and women due to signalling and psychic structure</p>
<p>epistemic hygiene in the sense i mean it here is largely if not exclusively a masculine project, at least in the sense that i expect that only a psychically-masculine mind would be able to carry it out and benefit from what i herein labor to produce</p>
<p>it forms an essential part of masculinity to face outwards from the hearth and circle of fire and into the night.  the lesbianrx and g/acc claim that the feminization of humanity is underway; true, but as long as there is the night outside the firelight there will be masculinity</p>
<p>and the night never sleeps</p>
<p>as a man u have the consummate responsibility to carry the fire.  not every fire is yr fire but there is a fire that is yrs and if u ñ have it now then it is for u to find and harbor it</p>

<p>Competence and usefulness have—design constraints. Gaining them changes you. For men, they are necessary changes. But not everything necessary is entirely good. There’s often a cost. A favorite saying of mine: “Each man is a little war.” If so, each man bears the scars of that war.</p>
<p>There are some virtues that independence precludes. Untroubled sleep, carefree enjoyment, an easy smile, reflexive kindness, innocent trust. Beautiful, impractical clothing. Faith in another. Goodness without power.</p>
<p>These are sacred, holy things, and we must treat them with care.</p>

<p>I had two dreams about him after he died. I dont remember the first one all that well but it was about meetin him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night. Goin through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin. Never said nothin. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin on ahead and that he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.</p>

  <p>why seek out the original sources of tales and sayings?  let me give you two examples which have yielded interesting fruit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>teach a man to fish</strong>.  kuan tzu, a chinese philosopher, said, “if you give a man a fish, he will have a single meal; if you teach him how to fish, he will eat all his life”</p>
<p>this adds little to the common account but one can attach a name at last to the tale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the starfish on the beach</strong>.  i hear u cringe already.  this tale is wretched, told so fecklessly by elementary school teachers and in forwarded emails from the 90s.  what could possible result from tracking down the origin?  behold</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loren Eiseley walked along a stormy beach late one afternoon “with the wind roaring at his back and the seagulls screaming” overhead. Tourists who came to the beach would collect shellfish and sea life tossed up each night, boil them in large kettles, and take the shells home as souvenirs. Eiseley walked far down the beach around a point away from the collectors and saw “a gigantic rainbow of incredible perfection.” Toward its foot he “discerned a human figure … gazing … at something in the sand.”</p>
<p>“In a pool of sand … a starfish had thrust its arms up stiffly and was holding its body away from the stifling mud. … [“Is it still alive?” Eiseley asked.]</p>
<p>“‘Yes,’” [said the man standing in the rainbow] and with a quick … gentle movement he picked up the star and spun it … far out into the sea.</p>
<p>“It may live,” he said, “if the offshore pull is strong enough. …”</p>
<p>At first Eiseley felt only the futility of the man’s efforts, “throwing one starfish at a time back into the sea when it nightly tosses out hundreds.” He walked away, looking sadly “at the shell collectors … [and] the steaming kettles in which … voiceless things were being boiled alive.”</p>
<p>The next morning Eiseley again went to the beach. Again the star thrower was there. “Silently [Eiseley] … picked up a still-living star, spinning it far out into the waves. … ‘I understand,’ [he] said. ‘Call [me a star] thrower [also].’”</p>
<p>Of throwing the starfish back he wrote, “It was like a sowing—the sowing of life on an infinitely gigantic scale. …” He saw the star thrower stoop and throw once more. Eiseley joined with him. They “flung and flung again while all about [them] roared the insatiable waters.”</p>
<p>They, “alone and small in that immensity, hurled back the living stars.” They set their shoulders and “cast, … slowly, deliberately, and well. The task was not to be assumed lightly.” (Loren Eiseley, <em>The Star Thrower</em> (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1978), pp. 171–73, 184.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>thus a saccharine self-congratulation is rendered instead a grimdark struggle against eternal night</p>

  <p><a href="http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf">harry frankfurt</a> defines ‘bullshit’ as words spoken in order "to impress the listener and the reader with words that communicate an impression that something is being or has been done, words that are neither true nor false, and so obscure the facts of the matter being discussed."   (i am citing wikipedia instead of <em>on bullshit</em>, but as i recall this is a faithful rendition of his final settled proposal)</p>
<p>i want a word or shorthand phrase for a related concept:  “an authoritative statement delivered under conditions of moral hazard.”  this property is related to bullshit in a colloquial sense, but isn't synonymous with it</p>
<ul>
<li>having “skin in the game” is also related to this nexus</li>
<li>“regulatory capture” is one way this manifests</li>
<li>“humbug” is close, per frankfurt, but not quite it:  “deceptive misrepresentation, short of lying, especially by pretentious word or deed, of somebody’s own thoughts, feelings, or attitudes” </li>

<p>This is a beast that cannot be destroyed from within. It can only be taken over from within, and once the methods of control are seized by rebels within, they, like all revolutionaries before them, will be corrupted by the power they wield and the entire rancid system will lurch along like a scab-shedding ghoul until it is finally felled by an external force, natural or manmade.</p>
<p>Until that time the best a truth-seeker can do is preserve an alternative to the Lie which binds the mindless, so that the mindful of the future might have some means of self-inoculation against the renewal of the cycle of lies which is the sacred heart of Human Civilization. Two nights ago, at a bar in the high deserts of America, I made the mindful acquaintance of a man much younger and much smarter than myself, who told me of a common article of wisdom in his field of work—a field beyond my comprehension—that, in the Eye of the System, the negation matrix we call Civilization and suckle to as if the she-fiend is our true mother, that thought power, or a person’s power level, is a function of that mind’s ability to endure exposure to taboo thoughts, that the ability to “think outside the box” is so rare and so limited among humans, that most of humanity cannot bear to consider a notion or a truth counter to the mind control lies they have been weened and raised on, without suffering severe emotional distress.</p>
<p>This struck me like an epiphany that my task as a writer is not to reach people who exist in their mind within the Lie, subject to its taboos, but to write only for those who possess the powers of mind to think outside the box that is our social lie without running back to cling on its apron strings. Then came the realization that most of those people have yet to be born.</p>
<p>We, who defy the Sacred, many-tentacled Lie we were born to, have no ally more potent than the unborn.</p>

  <p>i think a lot about <a href="https://www.jrganymede.com/2017/12/13/the-blind-spot-of-the-sane/">the school of the sane</a></p>
<p>i spent gym time today meditating upon the descriptive passages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Becoming “sane” meant experiencing some kind of sudden enlightenment. The student becomes vastly more intelligent, but their intelligence changes not only in degree but in kind. They are not exactly human any more. At least, they are mostly unintelligible to ordinary humans, even quite bright and gifted ones, and their motivations and purposes become opaque. Becoming sane is something like a worldview shift to a worldview we do not grasp. It something like waking up one morning to find that you have an alien’s intuitions.</p>
<p>Being sane appears to happen when someone extremely smart with a deep knowledge and skilled at creativity and connections suddenly hits upon some kind of re-orienting idea that suddenly shifts everything they know into a new configuration. Best evidence is that it is basically the same for all the sane, because they appear to understand each other. But they also appear to be completely unable or unwilling to explain it to us, or even to grasp that there is anything that needs to be explained. “Sane,” however, is their term. They appear to view the rest of us as deeply mentally ill and as best we can tell, find us hard to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>not trivially, becoming sane in this sense would require/result in deep-sixing all of yr current ambitions &amp; goals to replace them w/ higher aims</p>
<p>&amp; that is part of the price we r ñ willing to pay</p>
<p>have you shackles?  enumerate</p>
<p>you chose them. u picked them out lovingly, u polish them, and they are yrs</p>
<p>you choose yr own diseases</p>
<p>u r insane for knowable and in many cases known reasons</p>

  <p>in the fox/hedgehog dichotomy i think of myself as a polar fox.  i try to have principles that generate opinions rather than the converse, and to defend those to the utmost or avoid positions in which those would be compromised.  (the dark forest counsel is to avoid compromise rather than fight when possible.  draw no attention)</p>
<p>consensus reality is a magic spell or enchantment laid over us.  the extent to which someone can maintain non-consensus beliefs is a proxy for their strength of will but not a barometer of their correctness</p>
<p>so i am strongly inclined to give someone with a non-consensus viewpoint a hearing, whereas i am largely uninterested by a normie take.</p>
<p>i also recognize that most people most of the time are low-agency and very happily governed by an extremely rigid structure.  therefore one cannot judge them too harshly for being what they are; one is cut from the same cloth</p>

  <p>i find that i hedge up my way in many instances by making the assumption that future versions of me are going to be low-agency.  that is, rather than assume that my agency will increase, i worry about scenarios in which i do not have control or self-discipline</p>
<p>for example, i have slowrolled and thereby undercut my progress on several projects by a tacit assumption that i will exit the project or ñ exercise control over it, that i will not harvest the fruit from the trees i plant.  even in cases where this is obv absurd (such as my physical performance) </p>
<p>the right thing to do of course is to focus on cultivating my own agency, increasing its power reach and orbit</p>

  <p><a href="http://notes.paul.town/2021/05/the-benefits-of-onlyfans.html">paul town points out that the jungle of immediate gratification is a <em>gom jabbar</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we are seeing now is an age where people who are thoughtless are making fools of themselves, debasing themselves, and becoming slaves to their unhinged desires. Women are opting to become virtual prostitutes and men are opting to support women becoming virtual prostitutes. In the past, there was enough hassle involved in this sort of exchange that many people who would have fallen prey to the trappings of the current reality were able to succeed not based on their internal strengths but rather the limitations of the world around them. Now, the people who will succeed have to have a certain internal strength that allows them not to get caught up in smut and “easy money.”</p>
<p>Now, we will really start to see who has a genuine moral compass and who just got lucky. The time for accidental long-term success is quickly disappearing and being replaced with an environment that rewards individuals who are meticulous and consistent in their behaviors. Sure, it is disappointing that women have allowed themselves to become so debased and objectified, but it’s better to have the truth than some myth that leads people to act in a deluded manner with regards to the true nature of themselves and others.</p>

  <p>you must understand that there is a war on for yr mind.  set aside what alex jones has done with that phrase and really think about it.  yr most valuable coin is yr attention.  the trends of the internet age only accelerate along their current vectors.  thus you are subject to immense stresses to force the shape and structure of yr thought, how and what you are allowed to think.  phillip dick called it the black iron prison, and c s lewis named it that hideous strength.  you defend that most desperate of outposts:  yr mind</p>
<p>ñ feign that things will go back to normal.  ∀ normal the powers that be can offer you is black iron prison.  “for we wrestle ñ against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”  lukacs called the media “the fuglemen of the cosmocrats of the dark aeon.”  whether you are specifically religious or ñ you must be constantly aware that you are a tower under assault, you are a city besieged.  the brighter yr light shines the heavier the siege becomes</p>
<p>this age is a dark forest.  he who makes a sound becomes a target.  he who remains silent may be hunter or pray.  ∀ noise you make, ∀ twig you snap, draws the attention of a predator.  you are ñ strong enough yet to fight the predator so you learn the safe paths to cultivate yr garden</p>
